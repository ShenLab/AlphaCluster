# MVP3D


Note: 
1. We will change the repo name to something else that represents the project better. Any suggestions are welcome. 
2. The code from 1 year ago is largely obsolete. We will update the repo in near future. 


Main ideas:
The functional impact of missense variants is complex. A single deleterious score does not capture the complexity. For example, some variants are hypomorph, some are neomorph; some are loss of function, some are gain of function; some change the stability of the protein, some change the interaction with other proteins, and some change the enzymatic activity. 

In a particular condition, the contributing missense variants are likely to have consistent functional impact. This may be reflected in smaller 3D physical distance among these variants, or functional similarity as quantified by co-evolution. 

In this project, we aim to quantify clustering of 3D physical distance or functional correlation among missense variants, and to use it to improve statistical power of identifying new risk genes and to help interpretation of missense variants in genetic studies.
